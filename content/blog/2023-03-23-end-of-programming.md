Often they do, we call that automation. Automation of the software variety is often called "programming".

We do that.

Constantly in fact, we're positively neurotic about finding new ways to eliminate duplicate work.

We call those library dependencies.

Then you’d have a programming language. They exist to describe in human-readable and unambiguous terms what you want a computer to do.

We do that, for instance in DSLs (domain-specific languages) and multi-pass compilers. The GHC Haskell compiler uses at least 4 intermediate representations not including Haskell code itself or assembly/machine code.

Of course not, that’s why we continue to refine our tool-chains and new language communities are still forming with new approaches.

Just understand that we’ve seen claims of revolutions in coding productivity/elimination coupled with impressive demos regularly for over 50 years. The ideas that made a dent were few and far between, and even then the realistic implications were different than we would have expected.

So what have you got?
