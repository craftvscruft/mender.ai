# AI Tools

This page is for the emerging family of tools incorporating Artificial Intelligence techniques such as LLMs (Large Language Models).

This is field is changing fast, so check back for updates and feel free to [submit](https://github.com/craftvscruft/mender.ai/issues/1) your favorites.

## Coding Assistants

AI coding assistants operate as editor plugins offering auto-complete style suggestions during development. Gergely Orosz has a helpful [comparison](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1648705964659417090).

### Question Answering
* [Repo Chat](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/repo-chat) by Mckay Wrigley of Codewand

### Architecture Mining
* [FlowGPT](https://github.com/nilooy/flowgpt) - Generate flow charts from code


### SQL Interfaces
* [SQL Chat](https://github.com/sqlchat/sqlchat) - Chat-based SQL Client and Editor.
* [PG GPT](https://github.com/prabin-acharya/pg_gpt) - Postgres extension that generate SQL queries from natural language, and converts query plans to natural language.
* [LangChain SQLDatabaseChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/sqlite.html) - let an LLM agent interface with a SQL database.    

### Semantic Code Search

Semantic search attempts to consider the contextual meaning of the terms, as opposed to traditional lexical search which looks for literal matches of the query words and simple variants. In the context of language models, this is usually implemented with [embeddings](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html), but this has not been widely adopted for source code.

* [GitHub research blog](https://github.blog/2018-09-18-towards-natural-language-semantic-code-search)
* [CodeSearchNet](https://github.blog/2019-09-26-introducing-the-codesearchnet-challenge) - DataSet and Benchmark for training semantic code search models
* [sem CLI tool](https://github.com/sturdy-dev/semantic-code-search)
* [Source Graph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/getting-started-with-sourcegraph) - A leader in corporate code search. Here they use 'semantic' to mean 'language-aware', not using embeddings.
