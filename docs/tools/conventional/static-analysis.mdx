## Refactoring

Modern IDEs such as the JetBrains suite and Visual Studio (especially with [extensions](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper-cpp/documentation/resharper_cpp_vs_visual_assist.html)) have excellent refactoring support for languages including Java and C#. Here, we are focusing on tools that can be invoked outside of the editor.

* [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org) - Large-scale automated source code refactoring, focused on Java
* [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) - js/ts codemod
* [Putout](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout) - JavaScript Linter, pluggable and configurable code transformer based on Babel
* [Pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) - A tool (and pre-commit hook) to automatically upgrade syntax for newer versions of the language.
