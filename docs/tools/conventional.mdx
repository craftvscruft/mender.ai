# Conventional Tools

AI may be the focus of this guide, but it's NOT a magic wand. There are things that good old-fashioned deterministic algorithms will always do best!

## Static analysis

* [SemGrep](https://semgrep.dev) - Lightweight static analysis for many languages. Find bug variants with patterns that look like source code.
### Linters
* [Ruff](https://blog.jerrycodes.com/ruff-the-python-linter) - Python linter
* [Spellchecker CLI] - Run this on your markdown docs :)
### Dependency Analysis
* [Freshli](https://github.com/corgibytes/freshli-cli) - Display historical metrics about a project's dependencies (Supports Java/Maven)

## Refactoring

Modern IDEs such as the JetBrains suite and Visual Studio (especially with [extensions](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper-cpp/documentation/resharper_cpp_vs_visual_assist.html)) have excellent refactoring support for languages including Java and C#. Here, we are focusing on tools that can be invoked outside of the editor.

* [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org) - Large-scale automated source code refactoring, focused on Java
* [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) - js/ts codemod
* [Putout](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout) - JavaScript Linter, pluggable and configurable code transformer based on Babel
* [Pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) - A tool (and pre-commit hook) to automatically upgrade syntax for newer versions of the language.


## Doc Extraction

These extract API documentation in HTML and other formats from code comments.

* [Swaggar](https://swagger.io/docs) - for REST APIs based on the OpenAPI Specification.
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) (C, C++, C♯, D, Fortran, IDL, Java, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, and VHDL)
  * [Modern C++ doc stack: Doxygen, Sphinx, Breathe, Exhale](https://itnext.io/daily-bit-e-of-c-modern-documentation-tools-9b96ba283732)
* [GhostDoc](https://submain.com/ghostdoc) (C#, Visual Basic, C++/CLI, JavaScript)
* [Javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) (Java)
* [Godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc) (Go)
* [Rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustdoc/) (Rust)
* [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev) (Python)

## Language Translation
Use Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformation to migrate a codebase from one language to another.

* [C2V](https://github.com/vlang/c2v) Converting from C/C++ to the language V
* [Java to Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/java-to-kotlin)

## Code Visualization

* [Emerge](https://github.com/glato/emerge) - Graph-based code visualization in the browser

## Architecture as Code

Some teams prefer to maintain design diagrams as text in source control so they can more easily be kept up to date.

* [C4 Model](https://c4model.com)
* [Structurizr](http://structurizr.com)
* [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
* [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org)
