### Semantic Code Search

Semantic search attempts to consider the contextual meaning of the terms, as opposed to traditional lexical search which looks for literal matches of the query words and simple variants. In the context of language models, this is usually implemented with [embeddings](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html), but this has not been widely adopted for source code.

* [CodeSearchNet](https://github.blog/2019-09-26-introducing-the-codesearchnet-challenge) - DataSet and Benchmark for training semantic code search models
* [sem CLI tool](https://github.com/sturdy-dev/semantic-code-search)
* [Source Graph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/getting-started-with-sourcegraph) - A leader in corporate code search. Here they use 'semantic' to mean 'language-aware', not using embeddings.
