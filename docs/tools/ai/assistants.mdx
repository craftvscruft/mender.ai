AI coding assistants operate as editor plugins offering auto-complete style suggestions during development.

Gergely Orosz made a nice [comparison](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1648705964659417090) in April 2023 that has fallen out of date. 
[Updates welcome](https://github.com/craftvscruft/mender.ai/issues/1)!

# Command Line Assistants
These tools are optimized to convert a single plain language request into a shell command. The controlled scope tends to make this a more reliable LLM use case than full program synthesis. Worth a try!

It is recommended that any such tool confirm the proposed command with the user before executing, unless running in a sandbox.
