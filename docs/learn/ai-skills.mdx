## What is AI?

What we consider AI is something of a moving target. We use AI to refer to the most advanced programs we know how to make. A program that can play checkers was once cutting-edge AI. Now we would think of it as a "simple" Minimax search algorithm. Recommendation systems were an AI problem, now we tend to just call them "Recommendation Engines". There may come a day when we understand LLMs well enough that they are "just LLMs", only associated with AI for historical reasons.

In the current news cycle, people are very excited about GPT - and with good reason. However, we should not consider GPT synonymous with AI. It is distinguished by being versatile, not by being the best we have for every task. This is roughly where GPT falls in the conceptual space.
