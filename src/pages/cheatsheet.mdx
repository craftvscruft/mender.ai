# AI Coding Cheatsheet
**What works in May 2024 | [Download PDF](/pdf/ai-coding-cheatsheet-may-2024-v0.pdf)**

First presented by Ray Myers at [Mendercon 2024](https://mendercon.com), questions and suggestions [welcome](https://github.com/craftvscruft/mender.ai/issues/5)!

## Low-Risk Code Gen
* Human in the loop
* Prototyping / Greenfield
* Boilerplate
* Test-Driven Development (Ping Pong “Pairing”)

## Insight
* Question answering (kinda)
* Semantic Search on docs and code
* Commit Messages / PR summary
* Low-level doc generation
* Troubleshooting help (stack traces)


## Safe Modifications
* Tool-assisted refactoring
* Adding type-hints
* Backfilling Tests
* Dark launches
* Formal Methods


## Incantations
* Command-line invocations
* Regex (Regular Expressions)
* LaTeX
* Markup and styling
* Repetitive edits

## Hazards

* LLM-output is untrusted
* Vendor data risk
* Magical thinking
* Anthropomorphizing
* Unsustainable practices
* Ignoring the craft

## Making It Better
* Prompting
* Small Steps
* Tools / Feedback
* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
* Fine-tuning
* Better models ($$$)
